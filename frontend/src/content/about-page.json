  "intro": "Hello! I’m Cristina Jiménez, a creative and innovative communications specialist based in Paris, France.",
  "text": "\nWith over 5 years of experience working across the Dominican Republic and France, I’ve had the privilege of shaping communication strategies, managing social media, driving PR efforts, and crafting compelling content for both B2B and B2C audiences on regional and global scales.\n\nIn 2021, I fulfilled a lifelong dream by moving to France to pursue a master’s in Luxury Brand Management on a scholarship. Now, I’m taking my passion for communications even further by pursuing a second master’s in International Marketing, aiming to become a full-stack communications and marketing professional.\n\nBeyond work, I’m a self-proclaimed foodie, constantly exploring cuisines from around the world on weekends. As a passionate beauty enthusiast, I’ve also been refining my makeup skills since 2011, teaching myself techniques that continue to evolve.\n\nI am open to exciting opportunities, whether remote or in-person here in France, where I can bring my creativity and expertise to innovative projects and dynamic teams.",
