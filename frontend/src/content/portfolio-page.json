Using its employer brand platform, Mazars, The Smart Choice, we launched a campaign that highlighted key takeaways from the company’s Sustainability Report—all while attracting Gen Z talent.\n\nI produced a video for the campaign using Adobe After Effects, which was shared across Mazars’ social media accounts. This was my first video project at Mazars, allowing me to showcase my motion design and video editing skills. The visuals aligned with the brand’s EB content, using vibrant footage and motion design to capture the attention of younger audiences.",
