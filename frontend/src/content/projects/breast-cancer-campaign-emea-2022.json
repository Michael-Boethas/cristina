    "description": "The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign is a global movement dedicated to raising awareness and funding for breast cancer research, education, and medical services. In 2022, I contributed to its EMEA rollout, leading employee engagement efforts to ensure internal communities were informed and actively participating.\n\nI developed internal communication materials, including emails, digital posters, intranet articles, videos, and social media strategy. That year, we introduced employee ambassadors, providing them with pre-approved captions and personalized photos wearing pink ribbons to encourage participation.",
