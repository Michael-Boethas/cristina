  "description": "Reaching net zero by 2030 was a major sustainability goal for Mazars, but we discovered that employee actions had a significant impact on the company’s carbon footprint. To educate and engage the workforce, we launched an internal campaign highlighting Mazars’ sustainability initiative and how employees could contribute.\n\nThe campaign featured a mix of intranet articles, posters, screensavers, and an engaging video. I played a key role in scriptwriting, voiceover recording, and video editing, using visual storytelling to maximize impact.",
